### This repository has moved

My MineCraft mods and patches are now hosted on the following GitHub organization instead:

 * [GitHub: IQAndreas-MineCraft](https://github.com/IQAndreas-Minecraft)

And the main website for all these repositories is:

 * [minecraft.IQAndreas.com](http://minecraft.iqandreas.com/)


This repository is simply sticking around to redirect all traffict from `http://iqandreas.github.com/minecraft` to its new location.
